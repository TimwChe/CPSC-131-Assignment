For my stack programming assignment, I chose option 1, where I used vector for my stack class. 

My vector stack has the push, pop, getSize, and peek functions. I added functions called isEmpty, which checks if the stack is empty, and isBalanced, which will check the string for open parathesis and find if it is balanced.
